      <p>We’re still at the dawn of Marketing Automation and<a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/buyerview/marketing-automation-2014/" title="Software Advice" target="_blank">&nbsp;according to a recent research from Software Advice</a> (a marketing automation software evaluation company), many companies are still evaluating the tool and the opportunities and improvements it could offer them in their daily tasks. The key findings in the report on marketing automation buyer trends have established that 79% of the companies are using a marketing software (CRM, email marketing, industry-specific) but only 9% uses a marketing automation tool. But of course, those marketing software systems don’t offer the same range of features than in marketing automation tools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="">

Surely it requires some training and planning. But at the end, this time spent building a good online marketing strategy will be valuable in many aspects of your business.</p><p>Still in the same research, from <a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/" title="Software Advice" target="_blank">Software Advice</a> the two main reasons why companies are considering the purchase of a marketing automation software are improving lead management and the need to automate the marketing process. From my own experience,<a href="http://ez.no/About-eZ/Blog/How-To-Capture-Leads-With-eZ-Publish-Platform" title="How To Capture Leads" target="_self">&nbsp;lead generation and nurturing</a> are made easier by the use of the <a href="http://ez.no/Products/Digital-Marketing/Marketing-Automation" title="eZ Marketing Automation" target="_self">eZ Marketing Automation</a>.</p><p>On our side, after a very fast deployment process,we reaped the benefits of it very quickly.

The Guest Speakers</h2><p>We have some great guest speakers visiting us at this month’s Meetup.</p><p>Joining us from <a href="http://www.mugo.ca/" target="_blank">Mugo Web</a>, Vancouver, are Peter Keung and Doug Plant. Peter has written books and documentation about eZ Publish and manages some of the most complex eZ Publish implementations in North America. Doug is currently the Client Engagement Manager at Mugo and has extensive experience working on eZ Publish sites.</p><p>Also joining the meetup, to take us on a tour of the Symfony ecosystem, is Jeremy Mikola, a software engineer at <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/" target="_self">MongoDB</a>. With many years of experience, Jeremy is a member of the driver and evangelist team, and has helped develop PHP drivers and contributed to various OSS projects such as Symfony2. Since the eZ Publish Platform now has full stack Symfony2 implementation in the 5.3 release, Symfony will be a great tool to use for developers on upcoming eZ Publish projects.</p><a name="eztoc409944_3" id="eztoc409944_3"></a><h2>3.

The publishing giant&nbsp;is currently running eZ Publish as a core piece of their online strategy for digital content.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.grazia.fr/" target="_self">www.grazia.fr</a> project was a re-launch of the website's graphic interface as well as a technical migration. Their goal was to improve the user experience and readability of their articles for their online readers and extend the site's functionality and performance. The launch was a huge success and a great example of a modern implementation of eZ Publish in an online magazine.</p><p>Currently, Mondadori is efficiently rolling out multiple magazine websites using the eZ Publish Platform. We had a chance to talk to Maxim Thomas, Digital Technical Director at Mondadori France.
