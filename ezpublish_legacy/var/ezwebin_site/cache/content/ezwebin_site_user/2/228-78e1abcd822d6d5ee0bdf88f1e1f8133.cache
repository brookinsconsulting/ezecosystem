      <p>One year ago we were&nbsp;<a href="http://www.netgenlabs.com/Blog/2011!-What-a-year-for-Netgen.-Lot-of-expectation-for-2012-too" target="_self">summarizing&nbsp;year 2011</a>. Now is the time to underline what we achieved in year 2012 and also what we learned in the process. It will be interesting to see on how we met the expectations&nbsp;for 2012:&nbsp;to have more&nbsp;engagement,&nbsp;to work more and&nbsp;to earn more.&nbsp;</p><p>To generally compare these two year I would say that the 2011 was year of "execution" and 2012 year of "resource growth". The execution phase enabled the growth phase and by growth I mostly mean the increase of number of employees. In a year time we jumper from 8 to 13 which is&nbsp;definitively&nbsp;the biggest jump in our 10 years of doing business. It was also a very tough period as we are mostly a service oriented company depending a lot on the knowledge and experience we all have. We worked a lot and learned a lot on how to spread the know-how to new employees. It is a long process and you need to invest lot of time and be patient. The result will come. After a "resource growth" phase we need again an "execution" phase and that is the main goal for 2013. To execute our know-how in web development.</p><p>So how we met the expectation for the year?</p><a name="eztoc9114_1" id="eztoc9114_1"></a><h2>More Engagement? Oh yes</h2><p>To spread the business you need more leads, more opportunities, more projects, etc. Our way of getting all of this is through engagement.&nbsp;I think we nailed this expectation 120%. Could be even that we had too much of it :)</p>
<ul>

<li>Celebrated <a href="http://www.netgenlabs.com/Blog/10-years-of-Netgen" target="_self">10 years</a> of the company - this was more of an internal engagement but a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;milestone to share nevertheless</li>

<li>Presented on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.netgenlabs.com/Blog/eZ-Partner-Conference-2012-in-Lisbon-Overview" target="_self">Lisbon eZ Partner&nbsp;Conference</a>&nbsp;and on <a href="http://www.netgenlabs.com/Blog/An-overview-eZ-UnConference-2012-Cologne" target="_self">Cologne eZ Unconference</a>&nbsp;- we are consistent with all important events in our niche: eZ Publish CMS</li>

<li>Worked a lot on extensions like <a href="http://projects.ez.no/eztags" target="_self">eZ Tags</a> and <a href="http://ez.no/Products/eZ-Market/Explore-the-eZ-Market/eZ-App-Factory" target="_self">eZ App Factory</a>&nbsp;- we always aim to return to the community as much as we can through useful code</li>

<li>Written 25 blog posts on this <a href="http://www.netgenlabs.com/Blog" target="_self">blog</a>, about dozen on <a href="http://share.ez.no/blogs" target="_self">share.ez.no</a> - we try to share the knowledge to the community and to our own team at the same time</li>

<li>Written 22 week reports on our <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/117089428399193516011/117089428399193516011/posts" target="_self">Google+ profile</a> from <a href="http://www.netgenlabs.com/%20https://plus.google.com/b/117089428399193516011/117089428399193516011/posts/S1n2HUStXmx" target="_self">week 6</a>&nbsp;to <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/117089428399193516011/117089428399193516011/posts/ed9yxd73pEY" target="_self">week 52</a>&nbsp; - trying to inform&nbsp;regularly&nbsp;about our activities&nbsp;</li>

<li>Shared lot of nice pictures and videos on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/netgen.hr" target="_self">Facebook page</a>&nbsp;- mostly communicating on Croatian&nbsp;</li>

<li>Sponsored&nbsp;and co-organized two BEST Code&nbsp;Challenge&nbsp;student competitions - trying to find some future employees&nbsp;</li>

<li>Sponsored <a href="http://webcampzg.org/webcamp-zagreb-2012/" target="_self">WebCamp Zagreb</a> event, presented on ZGPHP meetup - helping out our industry locally&nbsp;</li>

<li>Did huge amount of tweeting on personal and company profiles :) - always informing followers and each other about some interesting stuff</li>

<li>I was personally involved in the <a href="http://www.netgenlabs.com/Blog/About-the-eZ-Product-Innovation-Board" target="_self">eZ Product Inonvation Board</a>&nbsp;(steering the eZ future a bit) and the <a href="http://exportboomers.com" target="_self">CISEx board</a>&nbsp;(supporting software exporters community)</li>

</ul>
<p>This alone would be enough, but no, we had to do something even bigger: we organized the first <a href="http://ezsummercamp.com" target="_self">eZ Publish Summer Camp</a>. It is hard to describe this event in few words, I can just say it was an amazing learn & fun experience. I hope all of attendees and all of my&nbsp;colleagues learned a lot in those few days and that we can repeat it this year too.&nbsp;Plans for the next summer camp are in the making :)</p><p>So if somebody thinks that we missed some&nbsp;engagement&nbsp;please&nbsp;inform me. We will try to correct it this year :)</p><a name="eztoc9114_2" id="eztoc9114_2"></a><h2>More Work? Yep</h2><p>As we hired more people by the end of 2011 and during the 2012 we also did more work. The problem,obviously,&nbsp;is this growth does not scale easily: new people need time to fit into the team and learn the stuff. That was the&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;part of the year, to integrate 5 new people and make them&nbsp;efficient&nbsp;part of the team. Also, part of this effort was to establish Netgen office in Osijek which added a bit more work overhead. Generally we did more work but it was on average less efficient then in the previous year.</p><p>By the way our main type of work is web development based on eZ Publish CMS. For example we&nbsp;re-implemented&nbsp;the <a href="http://iskon.hr" target="_self">iskon.hr</a> site with new design and built a completely new <a href="http://irb.hr" target="_self">irb.hr</a>. But this year, besides the usual project work, we were also involved in <a href="http://ez.no/Products/eZ-Publish-5-Platform" target="_self">eZ Publish 5 development</a>&nbsp;through out the whole year (released in November) + the new eZ Community <a href="http://share.ez.no/blogs/ez/a-reworked-personal-account-management-and-a-new-issue-tracker" target="_self">login system</a>.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc9114_3" id="eztoc9114_3"></a><h2>More income? Hm...</h2><p>As the income was more or less similar like in year 2011, we&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;didn’t achieve that goal. There were several reasons for that but mostly because of less efficient work explained earlier. In 2012 we increased the export ratio, we had roughly 60% income coming outside of Croatia. I would say the main reason for this is shrinking Croatian economy. The good thing is that we can substitute less local work with more international work.&nbsp;</p><a name="eztoc9114_4" id="eztoc9114_4"></a><h2>Main targets for this year</h2><p>Lets put it really simple again:</p><p>
- Work more&nbsp;efficiently<br />
- Earn more<br />- Maintain the engagement level</p><p>Almost the same :)&nbsp;Lets see in one year how we will perform...</p>

      <p>It’s that time of the year; time for festivities and good will towards people. In that spirit, I have decided to divulge a piece of knowledge for all the young eZ Publish apprentices as a sort of holiday present for all of you.</p><p>Everyone who follows this blog and especially this line of articles will wonder: Why now? Why didn’t I write an article about this sooner? Well, the answer is simple: I didn’t have the time. You see, things are buzzing with work here at Netgen and because of that we hardly have any time for anything else but work. But right now, I have some extra time for a new article and I told myself I’d better write it or else. What is or else, you may wonder? Well, I don’t know either, but it’s probably something nasty.</p><p>All joking aside, however, in this article we will cover not one, but two topics which will actually be wrapped in a nice little functionality which you can use. I told you I had a present for you all. So, we will cover the custom actions of eZ Publish, and the restrictions on content browsing.</p><a name="eztoc9085_1" id="eztoc9085_1"></a><h2>What are custom actions, exactly?</h2><p>The built-in content module of eZ Publish is great because it handles not only the views on which the whole content system for eZ Publish relies on, but also the actions connected to that content. Using the content actions you can create new nodes and objects, move or edit existing ones, swap nodes, delete existing objects, etc. But sometimes, the existing actions just aren’t enough for you, and that is when you need to rely on custom content actions.</p><p>Simply put, a custom action is the extended functionality for the content actions. This means that, if you don’t want to be bothered with creating a new module and views for some minor thing you want to achieve with eZ Publish, you can rely on custom actions to make your life a whole lot easier.</p><a name="eztoc9085_2" id="eztoc9085_2"></a><h2>Restrictions on content browsing in eZ Publish</h2><p>Content browsing in eZ Publish is a powerful tool which is often a bit underrated because it’s so cleverly integrated into the whole system that it pretty much goes unnoticed most of the time. You probably use content browsing on a regular basis, but don’t give it much thought.</p><p>For example, you have just created a content class which has an Object Relation attribute in it. When you create a new object of that class, and click on the Add existing objects in the Add objects in the relations section of the Object relation datatype, you actually get redirected to the content browse view which lets you pick and choose one of the objects you want to put into the relation. Additionally, the Object relations datatype even goes a step further and has a restriction for a content class or classes which you can put into the relation. As I said, this is something people rarely ever think about. This system just works and why change it?</p><p>But, as with any work you start in eZ Publish, sometimes you just need to create a custom feature which will work for your website only.</p><a name="eztoc9085_3" id="eztoc9085_3"></a><h2>How does this all add up, then?</h2><p>You’re probably wondering at this point how this all adds up. Why did I start writing about content actions and then restrictions on content browsing without even a line of code? Well, as with every other article so far, we are going to include a very specific functionality which will allow you to move a content object of a certain class, but only under a single type content class, and we will create a functionality which will restrict that move to start at a specific node inside the content tree of your website.</p><p>This will come in very handy if you have a bunch of users on your site, and for example, they are only allowed to move certain content objects into certain places or inside a certain content tree. It will all be much clearer in a second.</p><a name="eztoc9085_4" id="eztoc9085_4"></a><h2>Prepare your ground</h2><p>Of course, you’re probably eager to see the code for this cool feature. Well, before you do the actual coding part, you need to prepare the turf, as they say. So, in your extension, the <b>mypage</b> extension, go to <b>settings</b>, and then open the <b>content.ini.append.php</b> file. If there isn’t one, create it. In it, just put the following lines of code:</p>	<pre class="ezini" style="font-family:monospace;"><span><span style="">[</span></span>ActionSettings<span style="">]</span>
<span style="color: #000099;">ExtensionDirectories</span><span style="">[</span><span style="">]</span><span style="color: #000066; font-weight:bold;">=</span><span style="color: #660066;">mypage</span>
&nbsp;</pre><p>With these two lines of code, you have basically told eZ Publish that you want <b>mypage</b> to be the extension which will add some content actions to the existing ones.</p><p>After that, go up one level, and create a folder named actions in your extension. In it, create a PHP file which will be named content_actionhandler.php. This is effectively a look-for-code-here sign for eZ Publish. And then, when you open it up, just put in these few lines of code:</p>	<pre class="php" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;"><?php</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">function</span> mypage_ContentActionHandler<span style="color: #009900;">(</span> <span style="color: #000088;">$module</span><span style="color: #339933;">,</span> <span style="color: #000088;">$http</span><span style="color: #339933;">,</span> <span style="color: #000088;">$objectID</span> <span style="color: #009900;">)</span>
<span style="color: #009900;">{</span>
    <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">/* insert some code here */</span>
<span style="color: #009900;">}</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">?></span></pre><a name="eztoc9085_5" id="eztoc9085_5"></a><h2>On to the code!</h2><p>You need to enable your user to move an object. So, first off, go into the administration, choose the group of User you wish to be able to move, and create a content move policy for them. You probably know this by now. Also, open the template for the actual content class for the objects you wish to move. Let’s say it’s the <b>extension/mypage/design/mydesign/override/templates/full/myclass.tpl</b>. Now, insert the following code into the template:</p>	<pre class="eztemplate" style="font-family:monospace;">/* Changing the basic move form */
<form method="post" action=<span style="color: #66cc66;">{</span><span style="color: #dd0000;">"/content/action"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">|</span><a href="http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/4_x/reference/template_operators/urls/ezurl"><span style="color: #0600FF;">ezurl</span></a><span style="color: #66cc66;">(</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">)</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">}</span> id="move">
<input type="hidden" name="ContentNodeID" value="<span style="color: #66cc66;">{</span><span style="color: #0000bb;">$node.node_id</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">}</span>" />
<input type="hidden" name="ContentObjectID" value="<span style="color: #66cc66;">{</span><span style="color: #0000bb;">$node.object.id</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">}</span>" />
<input type="hidden" name="ContentObjectLanguageCode" value="<span style="color: #66cc66;">{</span><span style="color: #0000bb;">$node.object.current_language</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">}</span>" />
/* The bottom submit is usually named MoveButton, but for our new action we need a different name. */
<input type="submit" name="MyMoveAction" value="Move" />
</form></pre><p>Now, open <b>content_actionhandler.php</b> again, and insert the following code inside the function we created earlier:</p>	<pre class="php" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #b1b100;">if</span><span style="color: #009900;">(</span> <span style="color: #000088;">$http</span><span style="color: #339933;">-></span><span style="color: #004000;">hasPostVariable</span><span style="color: #009900;">(</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"MyMoveAction"</span><span style="color: #009900;">)</span> <span style="color: #009900;">)</span> 
<span style="color: #009900;">{</span> 
    <span style="color: #000088;">$module</span><span style="color: #339933;">-></span><span style="color: #004000;">setCurrentAction</span><span style="color: #009900;">(</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"MyMoveAction"</span><span style="color: #009900;">)</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>

The interesting part here is the <b>eZContentBrowse::browse()</b> method, which enables fast access to the content browsing without the need for any custom coding. And in our custom function we have fetched the node for our object and accessed the object, and then defined that the whole node and its subtree will be ignored in the browsing process. That takes care of the custom action part. Now, on to the browse restriction part.</p><p>Let’s say that, for example, you need to restrict the class with an ID of 30 to only be moved to a subtree of a different class, let’s call it <b>my_class_tree</b> and for the browsing to start at node 4 (let’s call it <b>my_node</b>). To limit your action in this way, you’ll need the <b>browse.ini</b> file. Which means you need to create a <b>browse.ini.append.php</b> file inside your extension. Type in the following lines in it:</p>	<pre class="ezini" style="font-family:monospace;"><span><span style="">[</span></span>BrowseSettings<span style="">]</span>

With these, you have just set up the browsing restrictions throughout the site for your custom action.</p><p>But, wait, you might say. Why did we need to create a custom action here? Why didn’t we just apply these changes for the regular move action in eZ Publish? The answer is very simple. We needed to create a custom action because every setting in the browse.ini file or a certain action behaviour applies each and every time that particular action is executed. So, if we just input the restrictions for an already existing action on the website, we apply that restriction everywhere. And in this particular case, we didn’t want that. We wanted to just apply the restriction for a certain type of content. And when you try to move your object after that, you’ll see that the browsing engine for eZ Publish starts at our desired node, and displays only the classes we told it to display.</p><p>
Until next time, I wish you merry Christmas and happy coding in the upcoming year,<br />Tomislav</p>
